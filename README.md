## Why Are We Building This?

There are a lot of Cloud Service Provider there, Netlify, Vercel, AWS, Serveless , Azure, Firebase, Google Cloud. Our Main Focus is to help people harness their FREE TIER without breaking a sweat to deploy a site.

There are a lot of Third party Services that offers great services such as Shopify, Squarespace et.al but paying a monthly fee on a starting business with no guarantee will just add up to expenses.

We are building this with a mission in mind, specially this pandemic to bring around 1 million business online for free using our platform that can help them deploy sites easily.

We are focus on

- Data privacy first ( you own your data and assets )
- Native Experience and Offline Ready (Modify Site Offline)
- Community-driven App Development (Feature Request from the Community at a price of a penny)
